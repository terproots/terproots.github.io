    <!-- TerpRoots: Recognizing and Revitalizing Terp Rituals (or Traditions)

TerpRoots aims to produce ways to connect current and incoming Terps to traditions that have existed for years. Through a virtual platform that enables our primary target audience, students, to post theme-based pictures and videos at Maryland events, we hope to develop a friendly camaraderie between students where they are more eager to attend traditional Terp events after becoming more connected to the College Park community. We plan to incentivize posting content on the platform by awarding students with the most popular posts different things like free food vouchers, free tickets to events, free Maryland apparel, and more! As the system expands, we plan to include parents, visitors, and faculty members because everyone should be able to experience and enjoy the Terpdition (Terp tradition) experience!

Why is this needed?
-Many describe college as being the best time of their lives. It’s a time where we learn more about ourselves, figure out what we want to do professionally, and determine what is required to get there. College is a time to make an abundance of mistakes and learn from those mistakes. Additionally, and most importantly for our platform, college is a time to live life and make amazing, unforgettable memories. At the University of Maryland, there are a host of traditions that have permeated through the years and have made campus life more vibrant. From rubbing Testudo’s nose or the Big Ten Kick Off to The Flash Mob basketball game, Homecoming, Or Art Attack, there are countless traditions that help students enjoy themselves and balance out the stresses of academic rigor. Recently, students haven’t been participating in Terp traditions. Attendance at athletic games has been lower, students have been skipping the Big Ten Kick Off, and Art Attack, or events at Homecoming, have an inconsistent number of people in attendance. With this being a high-tech generation, we believe our platform will allow revamp traditions by allowing students, faculty, visitors, and parents to engage with one another regarding these events and to incentivize attending and supporting these events.

How the system works? 
-One to two weeks before an event, we will post themes, hashtags, and filters on the platform to engage with students and get them revved up for the event! The platform would be compatible with existing social media platforms: Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. As posts are fed into the platform, students and surrounding members of the community will be able to like or vote for a post they like. As we get closer to the event, we plan on releasing what incentive the top post creators will receive. We will push out more engagement tools and set content engagement to be worth more points during the event than before the event. At the end of the event, the top posts will be announced and students, faculty, visitors, or parents who created the top posts will be able to claim their prize.

        <h3>Prior to contextual inquiry, our team collaborated on creating open-ended questionnaire and outlined the questions that we hoped would best uncover and address the root problem. We also did our research and looked into potential stakeholders to interview. Organizations on campus such as SEE looked hopeful. Our focus for interviewing stakeholders centered around finding the people with connections to the school’s organizations. Our focus for interviewing our target audience was slightly more open ended, as we were able to approach fellow students, parents, and faculty. We planned to observe traditions on campus for the alloted one-and-a-half hour observation requirement. Some traditions that we wished to observe are as follows: the rubbing of Testudo’s nose, coordinated cheers from the student body at basketball games, and swimming in the fountain in front of McKeldin library.</h3>
